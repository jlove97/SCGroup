<h3>John Allen Hendrix aka James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix</h3>
<br />

<p>John Allen Hendrix aka James Marshall "JimI" Hendrix, was born in Seattle on November 27,1942. Coming from a military family, Hendrix would join himself before being discharged and challenging the military industrial complex for the rest of his career. He is considered by many to be the greatest guitarist of all time with artists from all genres such as Prince, Marilyn Manson, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Terry Kath, Run-D.M.C. and many more! Hendrix's style, demeanor and skill mixed with his anti-war, anti-capitalism, pro-black message, perfectly encapsulated the trails of the times he lived in. That is the very thing that made him a target of the FBI's COINTELPRO operation which many believed led to his untimely death on September 18, 1970 at the young age of 27. </p>
<p>Jimi Hendrix left behind a legacy of greatness and a blueprint of living life freely. His concept of the Electric Church spoke to the peace he tried to achieve through his sound. He was quoted as saying,</p>
<div>"It's just a belief I have, you know, and we do use electric guitars.</div> 
    <div>Everything, you know, is electrified nowadays.</div>
    <div>So, therefore, the belief comes in through electricity to the people, whatever.</div> 
    <div>That's why we play so loud.</div> 
    <div>Because it doesn't actually hit through the ear drums - like most groups do nowadays.</div> 
    <div>You know, they say, we're gonna play loud too because they play loud.</div> 
    <div>And they've got this real shrill sound.</div> 
    <div>You know, it's really hard.</div> 
    <div>We're playin' for our sound to go inside the soul of the person, actually, you know.</div> 
    <div>And see if they can awaken some kind of thing in their minds, you know. </div>
    <div>Because there are so many sleepin' people."</div>
